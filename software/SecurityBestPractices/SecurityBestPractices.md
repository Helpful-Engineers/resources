# Helpful Engineering - Security Best Practices

Security Slack channel: #skill-infosec

As all teams are rushing to bring their solutions to production, we need to ensure that we are properly protecting all data that we capture and store.  A security breach could severly reduce trust in what we are building and impact our ability to help those in need.  The central Helpful Engineering organization is here to provide guidance and resources to help secure your project.  

# Services offered by Infosec Core team

* Security Design Review
* Code analysis
* Security Bug remediation assistance
* Pentration testing
* Issue remediation review and testing

# Protecting PII

Protecting PII is our top security priority.  Please reach out to the infosec team if you have any questions about this topic.

Protecting PII checklist:
* Identify PII
* Identify PII storage locations
* Classify PII
* Acceptable Use policy
* Encrypt PII

## Identify PII
Begin with identifying all PII that you collect, store, or process.  

## Identify PII Storage Locations
Identify PII data that is in use, at rest, or in transit.

## Classify PII
PII can generally be broken down into two categories: sensitive and non-sensitive

Sensitive data should include but not be limited to:
* Patients name
* Patients Address
* COVID-19 test results
* Medical professional contact information

## Acceptable Use Policy
Define who can access PII and what they can do with it.  It is important to confirm someones identiy before they are giving access to PII.  This can be challenging because everyone contributing is a volunteer.  We have confirmed cases of scammers scraping contact information of medical facilities looking for supplies to sell them fake respirators.

## Encrypt PII
PII should be encrypted at rest and in transit.  Please see the [encryption best practices](Encryption.md) for more details.

# Payment Processing
Helpful Engineering does not provide assistance with payment processing.  If your software application requires that please use an existing solution (paypayl, stripe, authority.net)

# Penetration testing
We have several resources and people available to help with penetration testings.  A development/QA environment will need to be made available to the team for testing.  To request a penetration test please reach out to the #skill-infosec channel.  Issues found will be documented by creating a github issue.
